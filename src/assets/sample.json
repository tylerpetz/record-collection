Trouble Will Find Me reached number three on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart.\n\nThe National began writing Trouble Will Find Me towards the end of the band's tour in support of previous album, High Violet (2010). Regarding the tour's completion, and the collective mental state of the band at this time, lead vocalist Matt Berninger noted, \"[We] felt satisfied at the end of touring High Violet. It was the first time ever, or at least in the past ten years, where we felt like we could put the band on the shelf for a little while, put a record out in three, four years. There wasn’t any sense of, 'what now?'\"\nBerninger, however, became inspired by guitarists Aaron and Bryce Dessner's recent demo recordings, and subsequently completed his writing contributions to the album's opening track, \"I Should Live in Salt\", a day after initially hearing it. Bass guitarist Scott Devendorf noted, \"Our typical way of working was to send stuff to Matt, then wait a while to get some mumbles back. He seemed really motivated and engaged with the new stuff.\"\n\nThe band began recording Trouble Will Find Me in late September 2012, at a converted barn in Rhinebeck, New York, named Clubhouse. Bass guitarist Scott Devendorf stated that Clubhouse was chosen primarily to establish camaraderie amongst the band, noting: \"The impetus to record upstate-- cooking, eating, working, hanging out together - was to achieve this music-camp feel.\" The first four days of recording were interrupted by a tornado which subsequently led to a power cut. Guitarist, keyboardist and co-producer Aaron Dessner noted, \"That night, by candlelight in the total darkness, we got really drunk and played the songs acoustically. It was the kind of scene that has never happened in the history of our band — and will never happen again.\"\nThe band subsequently relocated to Dreamland Studios - located within a converted 19th century church, in West Hurley, New York - to record the track, \"Fireproof\", entirely live. Inspired by the session, the band returned to Clubhouse and recorded both \"Sea of Love\" and \"Heavenfaced\" as one-take live performances. Recording at Clubhouse, however, was once again derailed by Hurricane Sandy, with Aaron Dessner stating, \"I drove back into the city because I was worried about my family and the potential flooding, and got stuck there for four days.''\nDessner, who co-produced Trouble Will Find Me alongside his brother Bryce, noted that his experiences producing both Sharon Van Etten's Tramp (2012) and Local Natives' Hummingbird (2013) led him to understand the importance of \"constructive, positive dialogue\" in the recording studio, whereas before he and his bandmates would often argue throughout the process.\n\nInspired by the recent birth of his daughter, Ingrid Stella Dessner, guitarist, keyboardist and co-producer Aaron Dessner began writing music with his child in mind. Vocalist Matt Berninger noted that he \"react[ed] to it in a very visceral, immediate, infantile way.\"\nThe lyrics to the album's opening track, \"I Should Live in Salt\", are directed towards Matt Berninger's brother, Tom, who directed the forthcoming band documentary, Mistaken for Strangers (2013). Berninger stated that he enjoyed the writing process for Trouble Will Find Me noting, \"In the past, it’s been hard to enjoy writing - like getting drops of blood from your forehead - but I loved the process for this record. I think a lot of it was because I wasn't worried - I didn't care what the songs were going to be about, or if they were going to seem depressing, or cool, or whatever.\" <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+National/Trouble+Will+Find+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album would become the band's breakthrough album, transforming them to international superstars and establishing them as America's number one band. The band would go on a worldwide tour to promote the album; Fleetwood Mac opened for the band during the tour. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eagles/One+of+These+Nights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead's highest entry into the American market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer expanded the band's worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included the singles \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\" and \"No Surprises\".\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album's artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote \"Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more than any other released this year.\" Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album's release to the era's feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said \"It's as pained and as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves.\" Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that \"the majority of OK Computer's 12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It's a huge, mysterious album for the head and soul.\" Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that \"Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I'm betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.\" In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the album \"is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen.\"\n\nThe album was also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is \"a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes\", but warned \"OK Computer is not an easy listen.\" An Entertainment Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that \"When the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead's growing pains, though, their aim — to take British pop to a heavenly new level — is true.\" In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the more musically conservative \"dadrock\" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that \"Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock.\" Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that \"Radiohead's third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but one of the year's greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing.\"\n\nDespite OK Computer's widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice granted OK Computer a B− but ranked it as the \"Dud of the Month\" in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked \"soul\", calling it \"arid\" and \"ridiculous\" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, \"For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency\". While a review in Time was largely positive, particularly praising the songs \"Airbag\", \"Paranoid Android\", and \"Let Down\", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, \"While the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers.\"\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer appeared in many critics' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk's Homework in The Face. The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK Computer first appeared in a \"best of all time\" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested that OK Computer's popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader's poll of the greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying \"Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering.\"\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing public opinion through its \"despairing-yet-hopeful tone\" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the \"New Labour\" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK Computer with \"killing\" 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that \"sound like us\" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of \"bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997\", Yorke replied \"Good luck with 'Kid A'!\".\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer—TV on the Radio's debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album's popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O'Riley and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said \"When I heard 'OK Computer,' after five minutes I said, 'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying to do.' And what they were trying was not so drastically different from what I was trying to do.\" Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead's best work and as a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

(also known simply as Today!) is the eighth studio album by the American rock group the Beach Boys, and their first of three 1965 releases. Although few realized the significance of the album at the time, Today! marked a major transition point for the band; notably Brian Wilson's production approach. The album is noted for its sophisticated, orchestral production methods and complex arrangements. The tracks on the first half of Today! feature an electric guitar-rock oriented sound that contrasts the second half consisting of ballads, showing an increased mature lyrical depth that would foreshadow future efforts like Pet Sounds.\nDespite the album's being a noted departure from the Beach Boys sound that largely pervaded prior efforts, the album was a commercial success; Today! climbed to number four in the US chart during a chart stay of 50 weeks and also reached number six in the British chart during the summer of 1966.

His personnel had become stable: alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley, tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, pianist Bill Evans, long-serving bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb. His band played a mixture of pop standards and bebop originals by Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie, and Tadd Dameron. As with all bebop-based jazz, Davis's groups improvised on the chord changes of a given song. Davis was one of many jazz musicians growing dissatisfied with bebop, and saw its increasingly complex chord changes as hindering creativity.\n\nIn 1953, the pianist George Russell published his Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization, which offered an alternative to the practice of improvisation based on chords and chord changes. Abandoning the traditional major and minor key relationships of classical music, Russell developed a new formulation using scales, or a series of scales, for improvisations: This approach led the way to \"modal\" in jazz. Influenced by Russell's ideas, Davis implemented his first modal composition with the title track of his studio album Milestones (1958). Satisfied with the results, Davis prepared an entire album based on modality. Pianist Bill Evans, who had studied with Russell but recently departed from Davis's sextet to pursue his own career, was drafted back into the new recording project, the sessions that would become Kind of Blue.\n\nKind of Blue was recorded on three-track tape in two sessions at Columbia Records' 30th Street Studio in New York City. On March 2, the tracks \"So What\", \"Freddie Freeloader\", and \"Blue in Green\" were recorded for side one of the original LP, and on April 22 the tracks \"All Blues\", and \"Flamenco Sketches\" were recorded, making up side two. Production was handled by Teo Macero, who had produced Davis's previous two LPs, and Irving Townsend.\n\nAs was Miles Davis's penchant, he called for almost no rehearsal and the musicians had little idea what they were to record. As described in the original liner notes by pianist Bill Evans, Davis had only given the band sketches of scales and melody lines on which to improvise. Once the musicians were assembled, Davis gave brief instructions for each piece and then set to taping the sextet in studio. While the results were impressive with so little preparation, the persistent legend that the entire album was recorded in one pass is untrue. Only \"Flamenco Sketches\" yielded a complete take on the first try. That take, not the master, was issued in 1997 as a bonus alternate track. The five master takes issued, however, were the only other complete takes; an insert for the ending to \"Freddie Freeloader\" was recorded, but was not used for release or on the issues of Kind of Blue prior to the 1997 reissue, Pianist Wynton Kelly may not have been happy to see the man he replaced, Bill Evans, back in his old seat. Perhaps to assuage the pianist's feelings, and also to take advantage of Kelly's superior skills as both bluesman and accompanist, Davis had Kelly play instead of Evans on the album's most blues-oriented number, \"Freddie Freeloader\". The live album Miles Davis at Newport 1958 documents this band. However, the Newport Jazz Festival recording on July 3, 1958 reflects the band in its hard bop conception, the presence of a Bill Evans only six weeks into his brief tenure in the Davis band notwithstanding, rather than the modal approach of Kind of Blue.\n\nKind of Blue is based entirely on modality in contrast to Davis's earlier work with the hard bop style of jazz and its complex chord progression and improvisation. The entire album was composed as a series of modal sketches, in which each performer was given a set of scales that defined the parameters of their improvisation and style. This style was in contrast to more typical means of composing, such as providing musicians with a complete score or, as was more common for improvisational jazz, providing the musicians with a chord progression or series of harmonies.\n\nModal jazz of this type was not unique to this album. Davis himself had previously used the same method on his 1958 Milestones album, the '58 Sessions, and Porgy and Bess (1958), on which he used modal influences for collaborator Gil Evans's third stream compositions. Also, the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell. Davis saw Russell's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord-laden compositions of his time, which Davis had labeled \"thick\". Modal composition, with its reliance on scales and modes, represented, as Davis called it, \"a return to melody.\" In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review, Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the simple chord progression predominant in bebop, stating \"No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things. When you go this way, you can go on forever. You don't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [melody] line. It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be. When you're based on chords, you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there's nothing to do but repeat what you've just done—with variations. I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them.\"\n\nReleased \tAugust 17, 1959\nRecorded \tMarch 2 and April 22, 1959   (New York, New York)\nGenre \tJazz\nLength \t45:44\nLabel \tColumbia\nProducer \tTeo Macero\nIrving Townsend\n\n    * Miles Davis – trumpet, leader\n    * Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley – alto saxophone, except on \"Blue in Green\"\n    * John Coltrane – tenor saxophone\n    * Wynton Kelly – piano, only on \"Freddie Freeloader\"\n    * Bill Evans – piano on all, except \"Freddie Freeloader\", liner notes\n    * Paul Chambers – bass\n    * Jimmy Cobb – drums\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Miles+Davis/Kind+of+Blue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album featured the Billboard Hot 100 number one singles \"How Do U Want It\" and \"California Love\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any of Shakur's albums. Moreover, All Eyez on Me (which was the only Death Row release to be distributed through PolyGram by way of Island Records) made history as the first double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption. It was issued on two compact discs and four LPs.\n\nChart-wise, All Eyez on Me was the second album from 2Pac to hit number-one on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award. Shakur also won the Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 24th Annual American Music Awards and is also commonly referred to as one of the greatest hip hop/rap albums of all time. The album was certified Diamond by the RIAA in July 23, 2014.\n\nIn October 1995, Suge Knight and Jimmy Iovine paid the $1.4 million bail necessary to get Shakur released from jail on charges of sexual abuse. At the time, Shakur was broke and thus unable to make bail himself. All Eyez on Me was released following an agreement between Knight and Shakur which stated Shakur would make three albums under Death Row Records in return for them paying his bail. Fulfilling part of Shakur's brand new contract, this double-album served as the first two albums of his three album contract.\n\nThe songs on All Eyez on Me are, in general, unapologetic celebrations of living the \"Thug Lifestyle\". Though there is the occasional reminiscence about past and present friends, it is a definite move away from the social and political consciousness of 2Pacalypse Now and Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z..\n\nThe album features occasional guest spots from 2Pac's regulars, such as former-Thug Life members and the Outlawz, as well as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Tha Dogg Pound, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, George Clinton, Rappin' 4-Tay, Method Man, and Redman among others. The song \"Heartz of Men\" samples a portion of Richard Pryor's comedy album That Nigger's Crazy. Most of the album was produced by Johnny \"J\" and Daz Dillinger, with help from Dr. Dre on the songs \"California Love\", which he himself appeared in also as an album guest spot, and \"Can't C Me\", which was Clinton's appearance.\n\nAll Eyez on Me received critical acclaim from a number of sources. The album was included in Rolling Stone '​s essential recordings of the '90s. Spin magazine gave it a 10 out of 10, writing that, \"As long as you don't expect philanthropy from Tupac, you'll find honesty and some pleasurably twisted scenarios.\"The record ranked No. 3 on Entertainment Weekly '​s list of Top 10 albums of 1996. A number of other sources celebrated or reacted to the album. AMG stated that \"despite some undeniable filler, it is easily the best production 2Pac's ever had on record\".\n\nOn MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, All Eyez on Me was listed as one of 2Pac's \"certified classic\" albums, along with 2Pacalypse Now, Me Against the World and The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory.\n\nRapper Soulja Boy has called the album his favorite of all time.\n\nAll Eyez On Me was released to a significant amount of critical praise and commercial success. It sold 566,000 copies in the first week of its release, and was charted on the top 100 with the top one-week. It was certified 5× Platinum after two months in April 1996 and was later certified 9× Platinum in 1998. It has shipped 10,000,000 copies in the United States as of July 23, 2014 and has been certified Diamond by the RIAA, which makes it one of the best-selling albums in the U.S. The album was certified for 60,000 sales in the UK by BPI by 1 January 1997. It has charted on Billboard 200 for 105 weeks in total.\n\nAll Eyez On Me is 2Pac's best selling album. It was re-released in 2001 as enhanced CDs containing the \"California Love\" music video. Both discs contained the same data track. It was also re-released as a Dual-Disc in 2005. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/All+Eyez+on+Me\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

What's startling about Sea Change is how it brings everything that's run beneath the surface of Beck's music to the forefront, as if he's unafraid to not just reveal emotions, but to elliptically examine them in this wonderfully melancholy song cycle. If, on most albums prior to this, Beck's music was a sonic kaleidoscope -- each song shifting familiar and forgotten sounds into colorful, unpredictable combinations -- this discards genre-hopping in favor of focus, and the concentration pays off gloriously, resulting in not just his best album, but one of the greatest late-night, brokenhearted albums in pop. This, as many reviews and promotional interviews have noted, is indeed a breakup album, but it's not a bitter listen; it has a wearily beautiful sound, a comforting, consoling sadness. His words are often evocative, but not nearly as evocative as the music itself, which is rooted equally in country-rock (not alt-country), early-'70s singer/songwriterism, and baroque British psychedelia. With producer Nigel Godrich, Beck has created a warm, enveloping sound, with his acoustic guitar supported by grand string arrangements straight out of Paul Buckmaster, eerie harmonies, and gentle keyboards among other subtler touches that give this record a richness that unveils more with each listen. Surely, some may bemoan the absence of the careening, free-form experimentalism of Odelay, but Beck's gifts as a songwriter, singer, and musician have never been as brilliant as they are here. As Sea Change is playing, it feels as if Beck singing to you alone, revealing painful, intimate secrets that mirror your own. It's a genuine masterpiece in an era with too damn few of them. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Beck/Sea+Change\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With the band's fanbase significantly expanded, the four members of Animal Collective moved back to their hometown of Baltimore, Maryland, in early 2011, to begin writing their ninth studio album. Avey Tare noted, \"I moved into a house that was blocks away from our high school - it was definitely a little bit weird to feel this mixture of old and new. [...] Just driving the same roads, going to Josh's mom's place. It's pretty much where we all started playing together for days and nights when we were in high school.\" Deakin elaborated, \"Just having the experience of seeing each other every day was what marked this record.\"  Avey Tare elaborates \"Yeah, we’d get up every day and just go play for about six or seven hours, then go home. Then the next day we’d do it again. It was like a workshop. The first week or so was just free-form jamming, trying to see what kind of sounds we could conjure up. Then it was clear that we needed more actual songs, so we started to break up the work a little bit — Noah and I might go off and work on some melodies while Josh and Brian might work on some drum sounds. Then we’d come back together and try to combine what we’d been doing. We recorded everything. We all had handheld recorders with us. Then we’d go through the stuff and pick out things that seemed promising, like we might pick out one interesting rhythm and then try to build a melody around it. We might take a section of one jam and try to build a song around it. Everything was labeled — all the recordings — and I think there were 13 or 14 hours of just stuff like that from the first week or so. Much of it wasn’t worth keeping, but out of that material, the new stuff was kind of born.\"\n\nAlmost four years after the album's release, Weitz intimated: \"Coming back for Centipede Hz was difficult. It was a super emotional time. Because of the way we set the making of that album up, taking us all to Baltimore, the unsettled nature came out on the record. It was just a very different process from the more easy going one that Merriweather had been. ... we wrote it for the stage and, before recording ... some of us got set ideas about what songs should sound like and where certain parts should fit in. Then, when we went to ooze all four of those different perspectives together—there weren’t battles, but it did lead to a lot of things staying in the mix.\"\n\nThe album was recorded at Sonic Ranch in January and February 2012 and was mixed at Maze Studios in Atlanta. Ben Allen, who co-produced the group's previous album Merriweather Post Pavilion, returned as the co-producer.\n\nIn an interview with Pitchfork Media, Avey Tare called Centipede Hz \"more grounded in one location\" and less ambient than the group's previous album.  The group also wanted the album to have a \"live-band feel\" to it. In turn, live instruments were used such as a sit-down drum kit and live keyboards. Centipede Hz also featured the first Animal Collective song where Deakin sang lead vocals, on \"Wide Eyed.\"\n\nWhere Merriweather Post Pavilion had more of a pop sound, Centipede Hz was a return to Animal Collective's experimental roots.[9] Writers have cited a wide variety of influences on Centipede Hz, including psychedelic rock, garage rock, Chicha music and avant-garde music. For specific bands, writers have cited, among others, Pink Floyd, Portishead, We the People, Milton Nascimento and Zé Ramalho as influences.[10]\n\nCentipede Hz displays a large amount of abrasive vocal styles, mostly from Avey Tare. As Merriweather Post Pavilion showed more of an ambient side to Animal Collective, Centipede Hz features more samples and live instrumentation.\n\nRadio commercials and station identification announcements were additional influences on the album's sound. This influence is reflected in the album's use of radio interference and white noise.  Animal Collective got the idea for using radio interference while re-writing the songs on Centipede Hz for a live performance at the 2011 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The group wanted a continuous sound when playing the Centipede Hz songs live, thus they used radio interference to do so.  Avey Tare noted, \"My brother was a DJ when I was growing up, and there was a radio station called B104 in Baltimore. He had recently got a CD of all the radio identifications that come between [songs], and we were going back through everything, listening to how weird and spacey and experimental it sounded. When you add that element to radio, it's this weird form of musique concrète. We thought it would be cool and also a little funny to have something like [sings like a radio segue] \"more continuous music\" in our live set, just because that's our style of playing.\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Animal+Collective/Centipede+Hz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It followed an abandoned session for RCA Records, and was recorded and mixed over three weekends at Strawberry Studios, Stockport in April 1979 with record producer Martin Hannett. The cover artwork was designed by artist Peter Saville.\n\nFactory did not release any singles from the album, and it did not chart despite the relative success of the group's non-album debut single \"Transmission\". Unknown Pleasures has gone on to receive sustained critical acclaim as a pioneering and influential post-punk album. It has been named as one of the best albums ever by publications such as NME, AllMusic, and Select.\n\nUnknown Pleasures was recorded at Strawberry Studios in Stockport over three weekends between 1 and 17 April 1979, with Martin Hannett producing. Describing Hannett's production techniques, Hook said, \"[He] didn't think straight, he thought sideways. He confused you and made you do something you didn't expect.\" Hook went on to say, \"Derek Bramwood of Strawberry Studios said that you can take a group that have got on brilliantly for 20 years, put them in a studio with Martin and within five minutes, they'll be trying to slash each other's throats.\" However, Hook went on to say that Hannett was only as good as the material he had to work with, \"We gave him great songs, and like a top chef, he added some salt and pepper and some herbs and served up the dish. But he needed our ingredients.\"\n\nHannett used a number of unusual sound effects and production techniques on the album; including the sound of a bottle smashing, someone eating crisps, backwards guitar and the sound of the Strawberry Studios lift with a Leslie speaker \"whirring inside\".[10] He also used the sound of a basement toilet, as well as several AMS 15-80s digital delays and a couple of Marshall Time Modulators, tape echo and bounce. Hannett recorded Curtis's vocals for \"Insight\" down a telephone line so he could achieve the \"requisite distance\". Referring to the recording sessions, Hook remembered, \"Sumner started using a kit-built Powertran Transcendent 2000 synthesiser, most notably on 'I Remember Nothing', where it vied with the sound of Rob Gretton smashing bottles with Steve and his Walther replica pistol.\" In his words, \"Morris ... had invested in a syndrum because he thought he saw one on the cover of Can's Tago Mago: \"you triggered it by hitting it. [Hannett] frowned on it because he wasn't the one doing the triggering.\"\n\nThe band members' opinions differed on the \"spacious, atmospheric sound\" of the album, which did not reflect their more aggressive live sound. Sumner said, \"The music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars. The production inflicted this dark, doomy mood over the album: we'd drawn this picture in black and white, and Martin had coloured it in for us. We resented it ...\" Hook said, \"I couldn't hide my disappointment then, it sounded like Pink Floyd.\" Morris disagreed, saying, \"I was happy with Unknown Pleasures. My theory on things at the time was that the two things—listening to a record and going to a gig—were quite different. You don't want to hear a record when you go to a gig: you want something with a bit of energy.\" Curtis was also happy with the production of the album and was impressed with Hannett's work. Hook conceded in 2006, \"It definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it ... But now I can see that Martin did a good job on it ... There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound.\" Hook also noted that he was able to hear Curtis's lyrics and Sumner's guitar parts for the first time on the record, because during gigs the band played too loudly.\n\nIn 1994, Jon Savage described the music as \"a definitive Northern Gothic statement: guilt-ridden, romantic, claustrophobic\". Analysing Curtis's work, music journalist Richard Cook remarked in 1983: \"sex has disappeared from these unknown pleasures; it is an aftermath of passion where everything's (perhaps) lost\".\n\nPeter Saville, who had previously designed posters for Manchester's Factory club in 1978, designed the cover of the album. Sumner chose the image used on the cover, which is based on an image of radio waves from pulsar CP 1919, from The Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Astronomy. Saville reversed the image from black-on-white to white-on-black and printed it on textured card for the original version of the album. It is not a Fourier analysis, but rather an image of the intensity of successive radio pulses, as stated in the Cambridge Encyclopaedia. The image was originally created by radio astronomer Harold Craft at the Arecibo Observatory for his 1970 PhD thesis.\n\nThis image became well-known, featuring on T-shirts (even parodied by a quickly-withdrawn Disney shirt). When reviewing the 2007 remastered version of Unknown Pleasures, Pitchfork critic Joshua Klein described the cover art as \"iconic\". Susie Goldring, reviewing the album for BBC Online said, \"The duochrome Peter Saville cover of this first Joy Division album speaks volumes. Its white on black lines reflect a pulse of power, a surge of bass, and raw angst. If the cover doesn't draw you in, the music will.\"\n\nThe inner sleeve features a black-and-white photograph of a door with a hand near the handle. It was some years later before Saville discovered that the photograph was Hand Through a Doorway, a well-known picture by Ralph Gibson. Author Chris Ott suggests that the album title was probably a reference to Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Joy+Division/Unknown+Pleasures\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Both bonus tracks also evolved from previous songs: \"Sick of Elephants\" was originally known as \"Sycophantitis\" and \"Self-Torture\" adds lyrics and incorporates the melody from the instrumental \"The Water Jet Cilice\" from Fingerlings 3. Haley Bonar who opened some shows on Andrew's tour sings background vocals on four songs.\n\nThe album debuted at number 76 on the U.S. Billboard 200, selling about 11,000 copies in its first week. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird/Armchair+Apocrypha\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They formed Yuck in 2009 in London, England. The pair released two singles on vinyl only (\"Rubber\" and \"Georgia\") in early 2010 and recruited Jonny Rogoff on drums and Mariko Doi on bass (who had just recently left the group Levelload) shortly after. The group began recording its debut studio album in the summer of the same year in London in Max Bloom's parents' house.[7][8]\n\nYuck released its debut single \"Holing Out\" on 20 February 2011.\n\nCritical Reception\n\nYuck received positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 81, based on 35 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[11] Tim Sendra of AllMusic called it \"an impressively assured debut from such a young band\" and wrote that the band's\" love of shoegaze and loud/quiet '90s guitar rock is unadulterated and it translates into the songs and the sound, making it a pure and easy-to-love album for all those who have ever been fans themselves.\"[12] Sam Majeske of Consequence of Sound described it as \"a refreshingly diverse album consisting of a dozen songs as enthralling as those from any of the band’s influences.\"[1] J. Edward Keyes of Rolling Stone's wrote, \"Yuck channel their college-rock jones with skill and charm, balancing in-the-red guitar fuzz with melodic sweetness.\"[21] Critics have also compared their sound to other bands such as My Bloody Valentine, Dinosaur Jr., Sonic Youth, and Pavement. Stereogum placed the album at number 13 on its list of the \"Top 50 Albums of 2011\",[22] with Spin placing the album at number 31 on its list of the \"50 Best Albums of 2011\".[23 <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Yuck/Yuck\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was initially self-distributed by the band in March 2009, and was eventually remastered and re-released once they signed to Frenchkiss Records in August. Vocalist Peter Silberman wrote the album after over 2 years of social isolation in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nThe album tells an explicit story (in first and second person narrative) of an emotionally abusive relationship, told through the complex framing metaphor of a man meeting a bone cancer patient in the Sloan Kettering Cancer Ward where he is working, falling in love, and eventually watching her die while he is beside her. Memories, regret and grief recur throughout the album.\n\nThe album has generated very positive reviews. Pitchfork Media endorsed the re-release of Hospice with their coveted \"Best New Music\" stamp. At the end of the year, the same publication named it the 37th best album of 2009, praising its \"power to emotionally destroy listeners.\"  Fan review sites like Rate Your Music and Amazon MP3 have placed the album in its list of Top 10 Albums of 2009. Popular music blog 20 Watts gave it a rating of 18/20 Watts and praised the album's \"realism and its sadness, found in its most abrasive lyrics and most expressive instrumental segments.\"  NPR Music placed the album in the #1 position for their Top 10 of 2009 list. onethirtybpm named it the best album of 2009. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Antlers/Hospice\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recording sessions took place from July to November of 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin. The album features the band's exploration of roots rock, with their music exhibiting influences from blues-rock, folk rock, Southern rock, and gospel music. Lyrically, The Joshua Tree depicts the band's fascination with America and many of the ideas it stands for. The album was produced and engineered by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.\n\nThe album increased the band's stature \"from heroes to superstars,\" according to Rolling Stone. The album produced several hit singles, including \"Where the Streets Have No Name\", \"With or Without You\", and \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", all of which remain radio staples. The Joshua Tree won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal and Album of the Year in Grammy Awards of 1988. In 2003, the album was ranked number 26 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The album is one of the world's best-selling albums of all-time, having sold over 28 million copies. In 2007, a remastered version of the album was released to mark the 20th anniversary of its original release.\n\nFollowing The Unforgettable Fire album, U2 realised that they \"had no tradition, we were from outer space\", and they explored American blues, country and gospel music. Since that album, they had spent time with fellow Irish bands The Waterboys and Hothouse Flowers, and felt a sense of indigenous Irish music being blended with American folk music. Friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Keith Richards encouraged the band to look back to the roots of rock music, and focused Bono on his skills as a song and lyric writer. The band wanted to build on The Unforgettable Fire's atmospherics, but also sought a more hard-hitting sound within the strict discipline of more conventional song structures, in contrast to The Unforgettable Fire's often out-of-focus experimentation.\n\nThe band interrupted their 1986 album sessions to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope Tour. Rather than being a distraction, the band found the tour added extra intensity and power to their new music, providing extra focus on what they wanted to say. The album sessions for The Joshua Tree proper began in July 1986 at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin.\n\nIn his earlier 1986 travels to Central America, Bono saw first hand the distress of peasants bullied in political conflicts, and this was a central influence on the album. The United States' military intervention in El Salvador angered Bono and prompted him to ask The Edge to \"put El Salvador through an amplifier\" for the song \"Bullet the Blue Sky\". \"Mothers of the Disappeared\" was inspired by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, the mothers of the thousands of \"disappeared\" people who opposed the Videla and Galtieri coup d'état that overtook Argentina in 1976, and who were kidnapped and never seen again.\n\nThe album juxtaposes antipathy towards the United States, including anger at United States foreign policy in Central America, against the band's deep fascination with the country, its open spaces, freedom and what it stood for. The band wanted music with a sense of location, a 'cinematic' quality; its music and lyrics drew on imagery created by American writers the band had been reading. The band had toured in the United States extensively, which affected the band; according to Bono, the album was inspired and influenced more by the country's geography, rather than its people. Bono said he \"...had to 'deal with' the United States and the way it was affecting me, because the United States' having such an effect on the world at the moment. On this record I had to deal with it on a political level for the first time, if in a subtle way.\" Since Bono was trying to portray the both \"mythic idea of America\" and the \"reality of America\" on the album, the working title of the album was \"The Two Americas\".\n\nThe record was also influenced by the blues. While in recording sessions for the b-side \"Silver and Gold\", working with Keith Richards, Bono and Richards listened to blues music, country music, American pop music from the 1950s, and other such influences. These influences, combined with Bono's early influences, such as Patti Smith and Bob Dylan, had an effect on the song and the whole album.\n\n\"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was conceived prior to one of the Joshua Tree recording sessions by guitarist The Edge. Bono conceived the lyrics with the idea that one could determine a person's religion and income based on where they lived in Belfast. While recording the song as a band, however, U2 ran into difficulty. The song's frequent chord and time changes caused problems in playing the song correctly; the difficulty was so great that producer Brian Eno attempted to erase the track. Drummer Larry Mullen Jr. later said of the song, \"It took so long to get that song right, it was difficult for us to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live.\"\n\n\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" grew from another song called \"Under the Weather Girls\", which co-producer Daniel Lanois didn't like, except for Larry Mullen, Jr.'s drum track and Adam Clayton's bass line. These parts were used as the foundation of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\". The development of the song saw the addition of such things as a subtle auto-pan effect added to one of The Edge's guitar overdubs and Bono, a tenor, singing in the upper register of his range to add to the feeling of spiritual yearning. Both Bono and Edge have, in fact, called it a gospel song on numerous occasions.\n\n\"With or Without You\", the album's first single and one of the band's most well-known songs, uses an effect called \"infinite guitar\", developed by Michael Brook, to infinitely sustain notes.\n\nThe band concluded recording of the album in November 1986.\n\nA number of songs that were released as B-sides to singles from The Joshua Tree are thought to have been considered for a double-album version of The Joshua Tree. Though Bono was the most vocal proponent of this extended version of the album, The Edge successfully argued for the 11-track version that was ultimately released.[citation needed] \"Spanish Eyes\" and \"Deep in the Heart\" were released as B-sides to the \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" single. \"Luminous Times (Hold on to Love)\" and \"Walk to the Water\" were released as B-sides to the \"With or Without You\" single. \"Sweetest Thing\", \"Silver and Gold\", and \"Race Against Time\" were released as B-sides to the \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" single.\n\nThe Joshua Tree was first released on 9 March 1987. The album cover photo was taken by Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn in December 1986. Corbijn later recounted the photo shoot in Death Valley, California; \"This is the most serious set of shots I have taken of U2 and they became my most well-known photographs at the time. It was taken with a panoramic camera to take more of the landscapes in which was the main idea of the shoot: man and environment, the Irish in America.\"\n\nIn 2007, a 20th anniversary edition of the album was released, featuring remastered tracks, along with B-sides and rarities. Four different formats of the remaster were made available.\n\n\"With or Without You\" and the rhythmic gospel \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\" were released as singles internationally and quickly went to #1 in the U.S. \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was also successfully released. \"In God's Country\" was released as a fourth single in North America with modest success, while \"One Tree Hill\" was released as a fourth single in Australia and New Zealand. Initially slated as a single release, \"Red Hill Mining Town\" was the only track from the album not played on the tour. Bono has suggested that the song's high notes put too much strain on his voice.\n\nUpon its release, The Joshua Tree debuted at #1 in the UK and also quickly reached the top of the charts in the U.S. U2 became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine (following The Beatles, The Band, and The Who), who declared that U2 was \"Rock's Hottest Ticket\". The album brought U2 to a new level of mega-stardom, as the worldwide Joshua Tree Tour sold out arenas and stadiums around the world, the first time the band had consistently played venues of that size.\n\nThe Joshua Tree won U2 their first two Grammy Awards, with the band receiving honors for \"Album of the Year\" and \"Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal\".\n\nAccording to U.S. Recording Industry sales figures, as of January 2005, The Joshua Tree ranks as the 89th best-selling album of all-time in the U.S. and, as of 2006, the 26th best-selling album in the U.K.. The album has sold 10 million copies in the United States alone and more than 25 million copies worldwide. It remains the band's best-selling album.\n\nThe Joshua Tree is often cited as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 1989, it was rated #3 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Albums of the 80's\", as well as appearing at #26 on the magazine's \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". The Definitive 200 list sponsored by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ranks the album as the fifth-greatest in history. The Joshua Tree was selected as #6 on CCM Magazine's 2001 list of the greatest Contemporary Christian music albums of all time (see CCM Presents: The 100 Greatest Albums in Christian Music). It came second place in Channel 4's 100 Greatest albums. It came in at #10 on ABC Television's My Favourite Album program, which aired in Australia in December 2006. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/U2/The+Joshua+Tree\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

But those shows weren't easily available whereas Live at Leeds was, and even if this show may not have been the absolute best, it's so damn close to it that it would be impossible for anybody but aficionados to argue. Here, the Who sound vicious -- as heavy as Led Zeppelin but twice as volatile -- as they careen through early classics with the confidence of a band that finally achieved acclaim but had yet to become preoccupied with making art. In that regard, this recording -- in its many different forms -- may have been perfectly timed in terms of capturing the band at a pivotal moment in its history. \n\nThere is certainly no better record of how this band was a volcano of violence on-stage, teetering on the edge of chaos but never blowing apart. This was most true on the original LP, which was a trim six tracks, three of them covers (\"Young Man Blues,\" \"Summertime Blues,\" \"Shakin' All Over\") and three originals from the mid-'60s, two of those (\"Substitute,\" \"My Generation\") vintage parts of their repertory and only \"Magic Bus\" representing anything resembling a recent original, with none bearing a trace of its mod roots. This was pure, distilled power, all the better for its brevity; throughout the '70s the album was seen as one of the gold standards in live rock & roll, and certainly it had a fury that no proper Who studio album achieved. It was also notable as one of the earliest legitimate albums to implicitly acknowledge -- and go head to head with -- the existence of bootleg LPs. Indeed, its very existence owed something to the efforts of Pete Townshend and company to stymie the bootleggers. \n\nThe Who had made extensive recordings of performances along their 1969 tour, with the intention of preparing a live album from that material, but they recognized when it was over that none of them had the time or patience to go through the many dozens of hours of live performances in order to sort out what to use for the proposed album. According to one account, the band destroyed those tapes in a massive bonfire, so that none of the material would ever surface without permission. They then decided to go to the other extreme in preparing a live album, scheduling this concert at Leeds University and arranging the taping, determined to do enough that was worthwhile at the one show. As it turned out, even here they generated an embarrassment of riches -- the band did all of Tommy, as audiences of the time would have expected (and, indeed, demanded), but as the opera was already starting to feel like an albatross hanging around the collective neck of the band (and especially Townshend), they opted to leave out any part of their most famous work apart from a few instrumental strains in one of the jams. Instead, the original LP was limited to the six tracks named, and that was more than fine as far as anyone cared. \n\nAnd fans who bought the original LP got a package of extra treats for their money. The original album's plain brown sleeve was, itself, a nod and nudge to the bootleggers, resembling the packaging of such early underground LP classics as the Bob Dylan Great White Wonder set and the Rolling Stones concert bootleg Liver Than You'll Ever Be, from the latter group's 1969 tour -- and it was a sign of just how far the Who had come in just two years that they could possibly (and correctly) equate interest in their work as being on a par with Dylan and the Stones. But Live at Leeds' jacket was a foldout sleeve with a pocket that contained a package of memorabilia associated with the band, including a really cool poster, copies of early contracts, etc. It was, along with Tommy, the first truly good job of packaging for this band ever to come from Decca Records; the label even chose to forgo the presence of its rainbow logo, carrying the bootleg pose to the plain label and handwritten song titles, and the note about not correcting the clicks and pops. At the time, you just bought this as a fan, but looking back 30 or 40 years on, those now seem to be quietly heady days for the band (and for fans who had supported them for years), finally seeing the music world and millions of listeners catch up. \n\nThe album was duly re-released on compact disc in its original six-track version early in the CD era. But the increasingly common practice of adding bonus tracks and going back to original source tapes eventually caught up with the Who. In the '90s, Live at Leeds was expanded twice, first as a superb 14-track single disc containing excerpts of their Tommy performance from that February 14, 1970, gig, along with all the non-Tommy music, and then in 2001 as a double-disc deluxe edition containing the entirety of the show. It's a treat to hear more (or all, depending on the edition) of this great performance, all in remastered sound, but there's something to be said for the original LP, which packed a lethal, lean punch quite unlike any other Who album. And what is equally amazing, hearing whatever form of the album one happens to have, is the nature of the performances -- one realizes, hearing them do \"Substitute,\" not how much it sounds like the record (though it does), but rather how amazingly fully the Who of 1965-1966 captured their live sound in that record; neither the Beatles, for certain, nor even the Rolling Stones ever nailed their live sound quite so well on their studio sides. \n\nThe same is true, in the expanded version, of \"Tattoo,\" \"I Can't Explain,\" \"Happy Jack,\" etc., so that hearing this album -- superb as it is in its own right as a self-contained musical entity -- only elevated the level of respect one felt for the band across its entire recorded history. And then there were those extended jams, moving from \"My Generation\" and \"Magic Bus\" into new and expansive territory, and showing that numbers like \"Sparks\" and \"Amazing Journey\" on Tommy had not been side-filling studio indulgences, but honest studio captures of the kind of playing that Townshend, Keith Moon, and John Entwistle had been doing for years. And this album, especially in its original LP form and in the single-CD expanded version, also showcased exactly how much Tommy, and a year of performing it on-stage, had improved Roger Daltrey's singing in intonation, control, and sheer power. It was the greatest Who album heard up to that time, and one of the best live albums ever done by anyone -- and ironically enough, was a stopgap release, to give the band time to finish its next project, the film Lifehouse. Even more ironically, the latter would never get completed, but in salvaging it the Who would create Who's Next, an album that came as close to matching Live at Leeds\n\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who/Live+at+Leeds\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Toronto dates of the 2112 tour were recorded and released as All The World's a Stage in September 1976. In 2006 a poll of Planet Rock listeners picked 2112 as the definitive Rush album.\n\nThe album 2112 features an eponymous seven-part suite written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, with lyrics written by Neil Peart. The suite tells a dystopian story set in the year 2112. Since the album is named after the suite it is mistakenly thought of as a concept album. Technically it is not, as the songs on the second side are completely unrelated to the plot of the suite. Rush repeated this arrangement in Hemispheres.\n\n2112 was the first Rush album listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\n[edit] Sticking to their principles\nThe band, pressured by their record company not to write another concept piece (after the previous album, Caress of Steel, containing two such songs, failed commercially), stuck to their principles and created what is hailed as their first masterpiece. It garnered them their first U.S. Top 100 album and would reach Gold status on November 16, 1977 (along with the band's then current release A Farewell to Kings and All The World's a Stage) and Platinum on February 25, 1981 (shortly after the release of Moving Pictures in 1981).\n\n\nThe 2112 suite\nMain article: 2112 (song)\nIn the year 2062, a galaxy-wide war results in the union of all planets under the rule of the Red Star of the Solar Federation. The world is controlled by the Priests of the Temples of Syrinx, who determine the content of all reading matter, songs, pictures - every facet of life during the year 2112 (\"The Temples of Syrinx\").\n\nA man discovers a guitar (ancient miracle) and learns to play new, different music from what he has ever heard. When he goes to present this to the priests of the Temples, they destroy the guitar. He goes into hiding and dreams of music; upon awakening he becomes severely depressed and commits suicide after a few more days in hiding. As he dies, another planetary battle begins (\"Grand Finale\") resulting in the (perhaps deliberately) ambiguous ending \"Attention all planets of the Solar Federation: We have assumed control.\" (This spoken section was created by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson reportedly \"messing around with a tape recorder\".)\n\nOn the album, Neil Peart credits \"With acknowledgment to the genius of Ayn Rand.\" Rand, a Russian-born American novelist and Objectivist philosopher, wrote a novella entitled Anthem (itself the title of another Rush song, from the album Fly By Night) from which Peart borrowed the broad strokes of the plot.\n\n\nRemaining songs\nThe other songs on the album stand alone from the title track, with Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson writing lyrics for one song each (\"Tears\" and \"Lessons\", respectively). All other lyrics were penned by Peart.\n\n\"Tears\" would be the first Rush song to feature an outside musician. Hugh Syme, who would play keyboards on a number of Rush songs in the future (ie. \"Different Strings\" on Permanent Waves and \"Witch Hunt\" on Moving Pictures) contributes a multi-tracked Mellotron string part to the track. \"A Passage to Bangkok\" and \"The Twilight Zone\" are songs typical of this time period of Rush. \"Twilight\" was written and recorded in one day. \"Something for Nothing\" closes out the album. Neil Peart states: \"All those paeans to American restlessness and the American road carried a tinge of wistfulness, an acknowledgment of the hardships of the vagrant life, the notion that wanderlust could be involuntary, exile as much as freedom, and indeed, the understanding that freedom wasn't free. In the mid-'70s, the band was driving to a show in downtown Los Angeles, at the Shrine Auditorium, and I noticed some graffiti splattered across a wall: 'Freedom isn't free,' and I adapted that for a song on 2112, 'Something for Nothing'\".\n\nCultural significance\nThe Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada, a non-profit Canadian charitable organization dedicated to promoting the preservation of Canada's audio-visual heritage, has sponsored MasterWorks, which annually recognizes 12 culturally significant Canadian classics from the film, radio, TV and music industries. In 2006, 2112 was one of the albums chosen to be preserved.\n\nTrack listing\nAll music by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson and lyrics by Neil Peart except where noted.\n\n\n[edit] Side one\n\"2112\" – 20:37 \nI: \"Overture\" (music: Lifeson, Lee, Peart) – 4:32 \nII: \"The Temples of Syrinx\" – 2:13 \nIII: \"Discovery\" (music: Lifeson) – 3:29 \nIV: \"Presentation\" (music: Lifeson) – 3:42 \nV: \"Oracle: The Dream\" – 2:00 \nVI: \"Soliloquy\" – 2:21 \nVII: \"Grand Finale\" (music: Lifeson, Lee, Peart) – 2:14 \n\n[edit] Side two\n\"A Passage to Bangkok\" – 3:34 \n\"The Twilight Zone\" – 3:17 \n\"Lessons\" (Lifeson) – 3:51 \n\"Tears\" (Lee) – 3:31 \n\"Something for Nothing\" (music: Lee) – 3:59 \n\n[edit] Credits\nGeddy Lee - bass, keyboards, vocals \nAlex Lifeson - guitar \nNeil Peart - drums, percussion \nHugh Syme - Mellotron on \"Tears\" \nCharts\n\nAlbum\nBillboard (North America)\n\nYear Chart Position \n1976 Pop Albums 61 \n\n Singles\nInformation \n\"The Twilight Zone\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\"2112: Overture/The Temples of Syrinx\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown \nChart positions: \n \n\"A Passage to Bangkok\" \nReleased: \nWritten by: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson & Neil Peart \nProduced by: Rush and Terry Brown\n \n\nRemaster Details\nMobile Fidelity Sound Labs issued a Gold CD remaster in 1993.

The most successful, \"Rebellion (Lies)\", peaked at #19 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2005 for Best Alternative Music Album. It received wide critical acclaim and topped many year-end lists. It was ranked eighth in Bob Mersereau's 2007 book The Top 100 Canadian Albums, and #2 on Pitchfork's 200 Top Albums of the 2000s\n\nInitial critical response to Funeral was very positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 90, based on 30 reviews. Allmusic reviewer James Christopher Monger gave the album a rating of four and a half stars out of five. He described it as \"brave, empowering, and dusted with something that many of the indie-rock genre's more contrived acts desperately lack: an element of real danger.\" Rock critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A-, saying that Funeral was \"...too fond of drama, but aware of its small place in the big world, and usually beautiful.\" Pitchfork Media ranked the album #2 on their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s list, after Radiohead's Kid A.\n\nDrowned in Sound also highly praised Funeral. Reviewer Jesus Chigley called the album \"...empowering and hopeful and euphoric all at once\", saying that \"it says everything there is to say about mortality and it does it in 10 tracks.\" Stylus's Josh Drimmer gave Funeral an A, calling it \"celebratory, emotionally rich and life-affirming\" Dave Simpson of The Guardian called it \"one of the year's best already, by a mile.\" Zeth Lundy of PopMatters complimented Funeral on its eccentricity, calling it \"bizarre at turns and recognizable elsewhere, equally beautiful and harrowing, theatrical and sincere, defying categorization while attempting to create new genres. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Arcade+Fire/Funeral\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

So if it feels a little weird listening to an album of euphoric, starry-eyed dance-rock on earbuds while you're scraping snow-grit off your windshield, keep in mind: Somewhere in the world, someone is probably road-tripping to a swimming hole with this album playing, or eating a popsicle, or playing catch with their dogs while it blasts out of a car stereo or nearby boombox. By the time summer arrives for those of us in the northern hemisphere, we'll know these songs by heart and be able to sing along loudly.\n\nBack when this group released 2004's Bright Like Neon Love, the idea of backing dazed, introverted indie pop with a utopian house thump was still relatively novel. And though that sound has since inspired legions of followers and copycats, still no one does it quite like Cut Copy themselves. 2008's steamrolling In Ghost Colours was an album of anthems; tracks like \"Hearts on Fire\" and \"Lights and Music\" were transcendent pop that stuck in heads for days. But Zonoscope is something different. It's an album-album that puts serious work into movements and transitions, and it works best when you hear it all in one chunk. That doesn't mean it's Cut Copy's OK Computer; it just means that the group has put more work into building a vast, rolling landscape rather than a series of peaks.\n\nZonoscope opens with a blast of woozy ecstasy in the form of \"Need You Now\", the sort of track where you don't even realize how much tension the group has built up until they release it, and ends with \"Sun God\", a marathon 15-minute groove that slowly morphs into a tranced-out Giorgio Moroder thud. In between those two tracks, Cut Copy build a long-form piece of work that moves between genres and ideas and moods without ever sacrificing its dancefloor momentum.\n\n\"Take Me Over\" works in a bouncy hook from Fleetwood Mac's mid-80s party-staple \"Everywhere\" and gives a sly nod to their countrymen Men at Work, turning down-moments into playful exercises in irresistible cheeseball melody. \"Where I'm Going\" is a twinkly, faraway sigh of a song that could pass for Washed Out if it wasn't for the titanic Gary Glitter drum-stomp powering it. And \"Pharaohs & Pyramids\" may be the greatest thing here; it uses the band's melodic gifts and the sense of yearning in frontman Dan Whitford's voice and applies them to a classic Chicago house anthem, deploying its keyboard blips, synth-strings, and programmed cowbells at the exact right moments, building into a climactic cresting swoop.\n\nCompared to the last two albums, Zonoscope has precious little guitar crunch, which makes it hard to even call Cut Copy a dance-rock band anymore. And that's for the best-- not just because that combination seems like a less thrilling prospect in 2011 than perhaps it once did, but also because Cut Copy have the architecture of dance music down perfectly and the confidence to execute the genre's moves with absolute precision. Even in the dead of winter, Zonoscope does its job beautifully. Imagine how it'll sound when you don't have to layer up to go outside.\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Cut+Copy/Zonoscope\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It's the fact that she had interest in us literally before anyone else cared at all which definitely boosted our confidence.” The track \"Treats\" contains an interpolation of the song \"Meds and Feds\".\n\nVocalist Alexis Krauss spoke of her enjoyment at the collaborative nature of the album making process with Miller, telling Drowned in Sound: “When we got into the studio we began collaborating more. There's a few tracks on the album - \"Tell Em\", \"Riot Rhythms\", \"Run the Heart\" – which definitely became more collaborative in terms of me doing more work on melodies, harmonies and we plan on further explorations of this in the future.\"She also spoke of the different vocal styles she employed to convey the meanings of each song. \"On a song like \"Infinity Guitars\", obviously the delivery is going to be much more aggressive and menacing while a song like \"Rill Rill\", you are occupying a much different state of mind when you're delivering those vocals.”While recording in Portland, the band employed people in the studio to contribute to \"A/B Machines\".\n\nTreats was recorded in January and February 2010. The song \"Rill Rill\" contains a sample of the 1971 Funkadelic song \"Can You Get to That\". <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Sleigh+Bells/Treats\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In addition, it debuted at number fifteen on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 21,000 copies, becoming M83's highest-charting album to date. Prior to recording Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, Anthony Gonzalez had moved from his native France to Los Angeles. Describing the move in an interview, Gonzalez said: \"Having spent 29 years of my life in France, I moved to California a year and a half before the making of this album and I was excited and inspired by so many different things: by the landscape, by the way of life, by live shows, by movies, by the road trips I took alone... I was feeling alive again and this is, I feel, something that you can hear on the album\" Gonzalez's tour with The Killers, Depeche Mode and Kings of Leon, in addition to his road trips to Joshua Tree National Park also heavily influenced the album. Gonzalez cited the ambitiousness of albums such as Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness as the reason he made Hurry Up, We're Dreaming a double album. In addition, he described the two discs as brother and sister, with each track having a sibling on the other disc. The album was recorded in Los Angeles at Sunset Studio and The Sound Factory. Because of budget constraints and union issues, the string and brass players who contributed to the album were not paid and were credited with pseudonyms.\n\nGonzalez recorded the album as a way to remember his childhood. Gonzalez explained to Spin magazine that Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is \"mainly about dreams, how every one is different, how you dream differently when you're a kid, a teenager, or an adult. I'm really proud of it. If you're doing a very long album, all the songs need to be different and I think I've done that with this one.\" In an interview with musicOMH, he described the album as \"a reflection of my 30 years as a human being\" and something he dedicated to himself. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/M83/Hurry+Up,+We%27re+Dreaming.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It peaked at number five in the United Kingdom and number 75 in the United States on the Billboard Music Charts. A concert film of the same name directed by D.A. Pennebaker was released in 1973.\n\nUpon its release on 6 June 1972, Ziggy Stardust reached number five in the UK and number seventy-five in the US. The album was eventually certified platinum and gold in the UK and US respectively. The only single from the record, \"Starman\", charted at number ten in the UK while peaking at the sixty-fifth spot in the US.\n\nIn 1997, Ziggy Stardust was named the 20th greatest album of all time in a Music of the Millennium poll conducted in the United Kingdom by HMV Group, Channel 4, The Guardian and Classic FM. In 1998, Q magazine readers placed it at number 24 and Virgin All-time Top 1000 Albums ranked it at number 11, while in 2003 the TV network VH1 placed it at number 48. It was named the 35th best album ever made by Rolling Stone on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2000 Q placed it at number 25 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Albums Ever. In 2004 it was placed at number 81 in Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of the 1970s. In his 1995 book, \"The Alternative Music Almanac,\" Alan Cross placed the album in the #3 spot on the list of '10 Classic Alternative Albums'. In 2006, the album was chosen by TIME magazine as one of the 100 best albums of all time.\n\nIn 2005, Seu Jorge did a cover album of 14 Bowie songs, many of them from Ziggy Stardust, as a soundtrack for the movie The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou called The Life Aquatic Studio Sessions. The translation into Portuguese is not always exact, as Seu Jorge maintains the melodies and styles, but often varies the lyrics. Musician Saul Williams named his 2007, Trent Reznor produced album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!, clearly in a nod to Bowies album.\n\nBowie claimed that the name came from a tailor's shop in London called Ziggy's. Bowie later told Rolling Stone it was \"one of the few Christian names I could find beginning with the letter 'Z'.\" \"Stardust\" comes from one of Bowie's labelmates, a country singer named Norman Carl Odam, The Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Bowie covered a Legendary Stardust Cowboy song, \"I Took a Trip (On a Gemini Spaceship)\" thirty years later on Heathen.\n\nThe Ziggy Stardust sessions began just a few weeks after Hunky Dory was released. The first song recorded for the album, the cover \"It Ain't Easy,\" was recorded in September 1971. The first session in November produced \"Hang on to Yourself,\" \"Ziggy Stardust,\" \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" (later shortened to \"Star\"), \"Moonage Daydream,\" \"Soul Love,\" \"Lady Stardust,\" and \"Five Years.\"\n\nAlso recorded during the November Ziggy Sessions were two more cover songs intended for the as-yet untitled album. They were Chuck Berry's \"Around and Around\" (re-titled \"Round and Round\") and Jacques Brel's \"Amsterdam\" (re-titled \"Port of Amsterdam\"). A re-recording of \"Holy Holy\" (first recorded in 1970 and released as a single, to poor sales, in January 1971) was initially slated for Ziggy, but was dropped in favour of \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide.\" \"Round and Round\" was replaced by \"Starman\" and \"It Ain't Easy\" replaced \"Amsterdam\" on the album's final running order. All three were eventually released as b-sides.\n\n\"Velvet Goldmine,\" first recorded during the Hunky Dory sessions, was also intended for Ziggy, but was replaced by \"Suffragette City.\" RCA released it in 1975 as the b-side to the UK re-release of \"Space Oddity\" after having it remixed and mastered without Bowie's approval.\n\nAfter recording some of the new songs for Sounds of the 70s with Bob Harris (which appear on Bowie at the Beeb) as the newly-dubbed Spiders from Mars in January-February 1972, the band returned to Trident. They recorded \"Starman,\" \"Suffragette City,\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Suicide\" by the end of the month.\n\n\"Starman,\" released as a single in April (and not intended for the final album at first), has never appeared in its original \"loud\" mix on CD. It differs somewhat in that it \"features a subdued 'morse code' section between the verse and the chorus\" compared to the original released in 1972. \"Starman\"'s b-side, \"Suffragette City,\" was mastered for the album with a three-note coda leading in from \"Ziggy Stardust\" to make the songs sound linked. They were never played as such by Bowie in concert.\n\nRecorded and released during the ensuing Ziggy tour were two other songs. The first, \"John, I'm Only Dancing,\" was recorded at Trident in late June and released (in the UK only) in September. \"The Jean Genie,\" recorded at RCA Studios in New York in early October at the start of the American tour, was released in the U.S. in November. The song was remixed for Aladdin Sane.\n\nRock keyboardist Rick Wakeman was given the opportunity to play keyboards on the album but Rick opted to join the progressive rock group Yes instead.\n\nThe album was intended by Bowie to serve as the soundtrack and musical basis for a stage show and/or television production telling the story of Ziggy Stardust. As well as the songs on the album, Bowie also intended songs such as \"All the Young Dudes\", \"Rebel Rebel\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll With Me\" (the latter two later recorded for Diamond Dogs) for this realization of the Ziggy story. In a Rolling Stone interview with William S. Burroughs, Bowie outlined the full plot of the Ziggy Stardust story:\n\n\"The time is five years to go before the end of the earth. It has been announced that the world will end because of lack of natural resources. Ziggy is in a position where all the kids have access to things that they thought they wanted. The older people have lost all touch with reality and the kids are left on their own to plunder anything. Ziggy was in a rock-and-roll band and the kids no longer want rock-and-roll. There's no electricity to play it. Ziggy's adviser tells him to collect news and sing it, 'cause there is no news. So Ziggy does this and there is terrible news. 'All the young dudes' is a song about this news. It's no hymn to the youth as people thought. It is completely the opposite.\n\nThe end comes when the infinites arrive. They really are a black hole, but I've made them people because it would be very hard to explain a black hole on stage.\n\nZiggy is advised in a dream by the infinites to write the coming of a Starman, so he writes 'Starman', which is the first news of hope that the people have heard. So they latch onto it immediately...The starmen that he is talking about are called the infinites, and they are black-hole jumpers. Ziggy has been talking about this amazing spaceman who will be coming down to save the earth. They arrive somewhere in Greenwich Village. They don't have a care in the world and are of no possible use to us. They just happened to stumble into our universe by black hole jumping. Their whole life is travelling from universe to universe. In the stage show, one of them resembles Brando, another one is a Black New Yorker. I even have one called Queenie, the Infinite Fox...Now Ziggy starts to believe in all this himself and thinks himself a prophet of the future starmen. He takes himself up to the incredible spiritual heights and is kept alive by his disciples. When the infinites arrive, they take bits of Ziggy to make them real because in their original state they are anti-matter and cannot exist in our world. And they tear him to pieces on stage during the song 'Rock 'n' roll suicide'. As soon as Ziggy dies on stage the infinites take his elements and make themselves visible.\"\n\nThe more generally acknowledged story, however, has Ziggy Stardust himself being the \"starman\", from Mars, who has come to save the Earth with messages of love and peace, and Bowie has referred to Ziggy as a \"Martian\" in several interviews.\n\nSimple two-syllable phrases provide the spine for \"Suffragette City\" (\"hey man\"), \"Hang on to Yourself\" (\"come on\"), \"Lady Stardust\" (\"all right\"), and \"Five Years\" (\"five years\").\n\n\"Starman,\" the album's single, has been described as a cross between mod and \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\".\n\nCorrect track listing:\n1.

Harvest hit #1 on the Billboard Music Charts (North America) pop albums chart, spawning two hit singles, \"Old Man\", which peaked at #31 on the Billboard Hot 100, and \"Heart of Gold\", which peaked at #1.\n\nAfter the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young split, Young recruited a new group of country session musicians, which he christened The Stray Gators and recorded a country rock record in Harvest. The record was a massive hit, producing a US number one single in \"Heart of Gold\". Other songs returned to some usual Young themes: \"Alabama\" was \"an unblushing rehash of 'Southern Man'\"; \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\" featured a lengthy guitar workout with the band; and \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" was a lament for great artists who had died of heroin addiction, particularly Danny Whitten of Crazy Horse. The album's success caught Young off guard and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. He would later write that \"Heart of Gold\" \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Neil+Young/Harvest\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Aqualung's success marked a turning point in the band's career, who went on to become a major radio and touring act.\n\nRecorded at Island Records' studio in London, it was their first album with John Evan as a full-time member, their first with new bassist Jeffrey Hammond and last album featuring Clive Bunker on drums. Something of a departure from the band's previous work, the album features more acoustic material than previous releases; and—inspired by photographs of homeless people on the Thames Embankment taken by singer Ian Anderson's wife Jennie—contains a number of recurring themes, addressing religion along with Anderson's own personal experiences.\n\nAqualung has sold over 7 million units worldwide according to Anderson, and is thus Jethro Tull's best selling album. The album was generally well-received critically, and has been included on several music magazine best of lists. The album spawned one single, \"Hymn 43\", and has been cited as an inspiration by bands such as Iron Maiden. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jethro+Tull/Aqualung\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Upon release, Emotional Rescue topped the charts in both the United States and United Kingdom.\n\n\n\nHistory\nRecorded throughout 1979, first in Nassau, Bahamas, then Paris, with some end-of-year overdubbing in New York City, Emotional Rescue was the first Rolling Stones album recorded following Keith Richards' exoneration from a Toronto drugs charge that could have landed him in jail for years. Fresh from the revitalization of Some Girls, Richards and Mick Jagger led The Rolling Stones through dozens of new songs—some of which were held over for Tattoo You—picking only ten for Emotional Rescue.\n\nWhile several of the tracks featured just the core band of Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Ronnie Wood and Bill Wyman, keyboardists Nicky Hopkins and band co-founder Ian Stewart, sax player Bobby Keys and harmonica player Sugar Blue joined The Rolling Stones on Emotional Rescue.\n\nThe album cover, designed by Peter Corriston, features a sombre selection of band photos which had been taken by a thermo camera, a device which measures heat emissions. The original release came wrapped in a huge colour poster featuring more thermo-shots of the band, the whole being wrapped in a plastic bag. The music video shot for \"Emotional Rescue\" also utilized thermo-shots of the band performing.\n\nReleased in June with the disco-infused hit title track as the lead single, Emotional Rescue was an immediate smash. The title track hit #3 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. The album gave The Rolling Stones their first UK #1 album since 1973's Goats Head Soup and spent seven weeks atop the US charts. The follow-up single \"She's So Cold\" was a Top 30 hit while \"Dance Pt. 1\" reached #9 on Billboard's Dance chart. Richards' \"All About You\" would be the first of several album closers featuring his increasingly gravel-sounding voice on lead vocal.\n\nThe song \"Claudine\" was rumored to be a part of the original album, but didn't make the cut most likely due to the fear of litigation and controversy. The lyrics dealt with the light sentence (30 days in jail) singer-actress Claudine Longet received after she killed her live-in boyfriend, Olympian ski racer Vladimir \"Spider\" Sabich, in their Aspen, Colorado home. She had previously been married to musician Andy Williams. Some other songs left off the album would find their way onto the next album, Tattoo You (\"Black Limousine\", \"Start Me Up\", \"Hang Fire\", \"Little T & A\", and \"No Use in Crying\"). \"Think I'm Going Mad\", another song from the sessions, was released as the B-side to \"She Was Hot\" in 1984. And two cover songs sung by Keith Richards (\"We Had It All\" and \"Let's Go Steady\") have yet to be officially released, but can be found on the bootleg Static in the Attic, along with \"Claudine\".\n\nIn 1994, Emotional Rescue was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\n\nSide one \n\"Dance (Pt. 1)\" (Mick Jagger/Keith Richards/Ronnie Wood) – 4:23 \n\"Summer Romance\" – 3:16 \n\"Send It to Me\" – 3:43 \n\"Let Me Go\" – 3:50 \n\"Indian Girl\" – 4:23 \nSide two \n\"Where the Boys Go\" – 3:29 \n\"Down in the Hole\" – 3:58 \n\"Emotional Rescue\" – 5:39 \n\"She's So Cold\" – 4:14 \n\"All About You\" – 4:18 \n\n Personnel\nThe Rolling Stones \nMick Jagger – lead vocals, backing vocals, electric guitar, and electric and acoustic piano \nKeith Richards – backing vocals, electric and acoustic guitar, bass guitar, and piano \nCharlie Watts – drums \nRonnie Wood – electric, acoustic, slide, and pedal steel guitar, backing vocals, and bass guitar \nBill Wyman – bass guitar and synthesizer \nAdditional musicians \nSugar Blue – harmonica \nNicky Hopkins – piano and xylophone \nBobby Keys – saxophone \nBilly Preston – clavinet \nMax Romeo – backing cocals \nMichael Shrieve – percussion \nIan Stewart – electric and acoustic piano and percussion \n\nChart positions\nAlbum \nYear Chart Position \n1980 UK Top 75 Albums 1[citation needed] \n1980 Billboard Pop Albums 1[citation needed] \n\nSingles \nYear Single Chart Position \n1980 \"Emotional Rescue\" UK Top 75 Singles 9\n1980 \"Emotional Rescue\" The Billboard Hot 100 3\n1980 \"Emotional Rescue/Dance Pt. 1/She's So Cold\" Club Play Singles 9\n1980 \"She's So Cold\" UK Top 75 Singles 33\n1980 \"She's So Cold\" The Billboard Hot 100 26\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Emotional+Rescue\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the band's first album of the 1970s and its first release on the band's newly formed label, Rolling Stones Records, after having been contracted since 1963 with Decca Records in the UK and London Records in the US. It is also Mick Taylor's first full-length appearance on a Rolling Stones album, the first Rolling Stones album not to feature any contributions from guitarist and founder Brian Jones and the first one on which singer Mick Jagger is credited with playing guitar.\nSticky Fingers is widely regarded as one of the Rolling Stones' best albums. It achieved triple platinum certification in the US and contains songs such as the chart-topping \"Brown Sugar\", the country ballad \"Wild Horses\", the Latin-inspired \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\", and the sweeping ballad \"Moonlight Mile\".\nWith the end of their Decca/London association at hand, The Rolling Stones would finally be free to release their albums (cover art and all) as they pleased. However, their departing manager Allen Klein dealt the group a major blow when they discovered that they had inadvertently signed over their entire 1960s copyrights to Klein and his company ABKCO, which is how all of their material from 1963's \"Come On\" to Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert has since come to be released by ABKCO Records. The band would remain incensed with Klein for decades over the act.\nWhen Decca informed The Rolling Stones that they were owed one more single, they cheekily submitted a track called \"Cocksucker Blues\", which was guaranteed to be refused. Instead, Decca released the two-year-old Beggars Banquet track \"Street Fighting Man\" while Klein would have dual copyright ownership, with The Rolling Stones, of \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Wild Horses\".\n\n\nRecording\nAlthough sessions for Sticky Fingers began in earnest in March 1970, The Rolling Stones had recorded at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama in December 1969 and \"Sister Morphine\", cut during Let It Bleed's sessions earlier in March of that year, was held over for this release. Much of the recording for Sticky Fingers was made with The Rolling Stones' mobile studio unit in Stargroves during the summer and autumn of 1970. Early versions of songs that would appear on Exile on Main St. were also rehearsed during these sessions\n\nArtwork\n\nStandard version:\nThe Rolling Stones posing in an ad with the artwork from Sticky Fingers in 1971, from left to right: Charlie Watts, Mick Taylor, Bill Wyman, Keith Richards, and Mick Jagger\nThe album's artwork emphasises the suggestive innuendo of the Sticky Fingers title, showing a close-up of a jeans-clad male crotch with the visible outline of a large penis; the cover of the original (vinyl) release featured a working zipper and mock belt buckle that opened to reveal cotton briefs. The vinyl release displayed the band's name and album title along the image of the belt; behind the zipper the white briefs were seemingly rubber stamped in gold with the name of American pop artist Andy Warhol, below which read \"THIS PHOTOGRAPH MAY NOT BE—ETC.\" While the artwork was conceived by Warhol, photography was by Billy Name and design by Craig Braun.\n\nThe cover photo of a male model's crotch clad in tight blue jeans was assumed by many fans to be an image of Mick Jagger, but the people actually involved at the time of the photo shoot claim that Warhol had several different men photographed (Jagger was not among them) and never revealed which shots he used. Among the candidates, Jed Johnson, Warhol's lover at the time, denied it was his likeness, although his twin brother Jay is a possibility. Those closest to the shoot, and subsequent design, name Factory artist and designer Corey Tippin as the likeliest candidate. Warhol \"superstar\" Joe Dallesandro claims to have been the model.\nAfter retailers complained that the zipper was causing damage to the vinyl (from stacked shipments of the record), the zipper was \"unzipped\" slightly to the middle of the record, where damage would be minimised.\nThe album features the first usage of the band's \"tongue & lips\" logo, which was originally designed by Ernie Cefalu. Although Ernie's version was used for much of the merchandising and was the design originally shown to the band by Craig Braun, the design used for the album was illustrated by John Pasche.\nIn 2003, the TV network VH1 named Sticky Fingers the \"No. 1 Greatest Album Cover\" of all time.\n\nAlternative version and covers\nIn Spain, the original cover was censored and replaced with a \"Can of fingers\" cover, and \"Sister Morphine\" was replaced by a live version of Chuck Berry's \"Let It Rock\". This version was released on the compilation album Rarities 1971–2003 in 2005.\nIn 1992, the LP release of the album in Russia featured a similar treatment as the original cover; but with Cyrillic lettering for the band name and album name, a colourised photograph of blue jeans with a zipper, and a Soviet Army uniform belt buckle that shows a hammer and sickle inscribed in a star. The model appears to be female.\n\n\nRelease and reception:\nSticky Fingers hit the number one spot on the British charts in May 1971, remaining there for four weeks before returning at number one for a further week in mid June. In the US, the album hit number one within days of release, and stayed there for four weeks. In Germany it was one of only two non-German albums to reach number one in 1971.\nIn a contemporary review for the Los Angeles Times, music critic Robert Hilburn said that although Sticky Fingers is one of the best rock albums of the year, it is only \"modest\" by the Rolling Stones' standards and succeeds on the strength of songs such as \"Bitch\" and \"Dead Flowers\", which recall the band's previously uninhibited, furious style. Jon Landau, writing in Rolling Stone, felt that it lacks the spirit and spontaneity of the Rolling Stones' previous two albums and, apart from \"Moonlight Mile\", is full of \"forced attempts at style and control\" in which the band sounds disinterested, particularly on formally correct songs such as \"Brown Sugar\". In a positive review, Lynn Van Matre of the Chicago Tribune viewed the album as the band \"at their raunchy best\" and wrote that, although it is \"hardly innovative\", it is consistent enough to be one of the year's best albums.\nSticky Fingers was voted the second best album of the year in The Village Voice '​s annual Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1971. Lester Bangs voted it number one in the poll and said that it was his most played album of the year. Robert Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked the album seventeenth on his own year-end list. In a 1975 article for The Village Voice, Christgau suggested that the release was \"triffling with decadence\", but might be the Rolling Stones' best album, approached only by Exile on Main St. (1972). In his 1980 review of the album, he wrote that it reflected how unapologetic the band was after the Altamont Free Concert and that, despite the concession to sincerity with \"Wild Horses\", songs such as \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" and \"I Got the Blues\" are as \"soulful\" as \"Good Times\", and their cover of \"You Gotta Move\" is on-par with their previous covers of \"Prodigal Son\" and \"Love in Vain\".\nIn 1994, Sticky Fingers was ranked number ten in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. He stated, \"Dirty rock like this has still to be bettered, and there is still no rival in sight.\" In a retrospective review, Q magazine said that the album was \"the Stones at their assured, showboating peak ... A magic formula of heavy soul, junkie blues and macho rock\". NME wrote that it \"captures the Stones bluesy swagger\" in a \"dark-land where few dare to tread\". Record Collector magazine said that it showcases Jagger and Richards as they \"delve even further back to the primitive blues that first inspired them and step up their investigations into another great American form, country.\" In his review for Goldmine magazine, Dave Thompson wrote that the album still is superior to \"most of The Rolling Stones’ catalog\".In 2003, Sticky Fingers was listed as No. 63 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\nIn 1994, Sticky Fingers was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records. It was remastered again in 2009 by Universal Music Enterprises and in 2011 by Universal Music Enterprises in a Japanese-only SHM-SACD version.\nOn 31 March 2015, The Rolling Stones announced that Sticky Fingers will be reissued (this time in relation to a new concert tour, the Zip Code Tour). These Deluxe and Super Deluxe reissues will be released on 8/9 June 2015 in a variety of formats and will feature a variety of extensive (previously unreleased) rare bonus material (depending on the format): alternative re-workings of some tracks, live tracks from the two Rolling Stones shows on 14 March 1971 at the Roundhouse, London and live tracks from the Rolling Stones show on 13 March 1971 at the Leeds University-\n\n\nTrack listing:\n\nAll songs written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, except where noted.\n\nSide one:\t\nNo.  Title\tLength\t\n1.\t\"Brown Sugar\"  \t3:48\n2.\t\"Sway\"  \t3:50    (Jagger/Taylor)\n3.\t\"Wild Horses\"  \t5:42\n4.\t\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\"  \t7:14\n5.\t\"You Gotta Move\" (Fred McDowell/Gary Davis)\t2:32\nSide two:\t\nNo.\t Title\tLength\t\n6.\t\"Bitch\"  \t3:38\n7.\t\"I Got the Blues\"  \t3:54\n8.\t\"Sister Morphine\" (Jagger/Richards/Marianne Faithfull)\t5:31\n9.\t\"Dead Flowers\"  \t4:03\n10.\t\"Moonlight Mile\"  \n\n\nPersonnel:\nThe Rolling Stones\nMick Jagger – lead vocals; acoustic guitar on \"Dead Flowers\" and \"Moonlight Mile\"; rhythm guitar on \"Sway\"; percussion on \"Brown Sugar\"\nKeith Richards – rhythm guitar; acoustic guitar on \"Brown Sugar\", \"You Gotta Move\", \"I Got the Blues\" and \"Sister Morphine\"; twelve string acoustic guitar on \"Wild Horses\"; lead guitar on \"Wild Horses\", the first part of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" and \"Bitch\"; co-lead guitar on \"Dead Flowers\", backing vocals\nMick Taylor – lead guitar; acoustic guitar on \"Wild Horses\"; rhythm guitar on the first part of \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" and \"Bitch\"; slide guitar on \"Sway\" and \"You Gotta Move\"; lead guitar on \"Dead Flowers\" \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" \"Moonlight Mile\" \"Sway\" (not present during \"Sister Morphine\" sessions)\nBill Wyman – bass guitar; electric piano on \"You Gotta Move\"\nCharlie Watts – drums\nAdditional personnel:\nPaul Buckmaster – string arrangement on \"Sway\" and \"Moonlight Mile\"\nRy Cooder – slide guitar on \"Sister Morphine\"\nJim Dickinson – piano on \"Wild Horses\"\nRocky Dijon – congas on \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\"\nNicky Hopkins – piano on \"Sway\", \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\"\nBobby Keys – saxophone\nJimmy Miller – percussion on \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\"\nJack Nitzsche – piano on \"Sister Morphine\"\nBilly Preston – organ on \"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\" and \"I Got the Blues\"\nJim Price – trumpet, piano on \"Moonlight Mile\"\nIan Stewart – piano on \"Brown Sugar\" and \"Dead Flowers\"\nEngineers – Glyn Johns, Andy Johns, Chris Kimsey, Jimmy Johnson\nCover concept/photography – Andy Warhol <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Sticky+Fingers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded as the follow-up to 1972's critically acclaimed Exile on Main Street. Goats Head Soup was a more polished production than the raw and ragged Exile. It reflected the resurgence of soul-pop and the rise of funk, while maintaining the Stones' distinctive rock sound. It spawned the hit single \"Angie\", by far its best-known track, and topped the charts in both the US and the UK.\n\n History\n\n[edit] Recording\nRecording began as early as 1970. Two tracks, \"Silver Train\" and \"Hide Your Love\", resulted from these early sessions and re-appeared in November 1972 when the band relocated to Kingston, Jamaica's Dynamic Sound Studios. Guitarist Keith Richards said in 2002, \"Jamaica was one of the few places that would let us all in! By that time about the only country that I was allowed to exist in was Switzerland, which was damn boring for me, at least for the first year, because I didn't like to ski... Nine countries kicked me out, thank you very much, so it was a matter of how to keep this thing together...\"\n\nOf the recording process, Marshall Chess, the president of Rolling Stones Records at the time, said in 2002, \"We used to book studios for a month, 24 hours a day, so that the band could keep the same set-up and develop their songs in their free-form way, starting with a few lyrics and rhythms, jamming and rehearsing while we fixed the sound. It amazed me, as an old-time record guy, that the Stones might not have played together for six or eight months, but within an hour of jamming, the synergy that is their strength would come into play and they would lock it together as one...\"\n\nJagger said of their approach to recording at the time, \"Songwriting and playing is a mood. Like the last album we did (Exile on Main St.) was basically recorded in short concentrated periods. Two weeks here, two weeks there - then another two weeks. And, similarly, all the writing was concentrated so that you get the feel of one particular period of time. Three months later it's all very different and we won't be writing the same kind of material as Goats Head Soup.\"\n\nOn the sessions and influence of the island, Richards said, \"The album itself didn't take that long, but we recorded an awful lot of tracks. There were not only Jamaicans involved, but also percussion players who came from places like Guyana, a travelling pool of guys who worked in the studios. It was interesting to be playing in this totally different atmosphere. Mikey Chung, the engineer at Dynamic, for example, was a Chinese man — you realise how much Jamaica is a multi-ethnic environment.\"\n\nThe first track recorded at Dynamic was \"Winter\", which lead guitarist Mick Taylor said started with \"just Mick (Jagger) strumming on a guitar in the studio, and everything falling together from there.\"\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Angie\", was an unpopular choice as lead single with Atlantic Records which, according to Chess, \"wanted another 'Brown Sugar' rather than a ballad.\" Contrary to popular belief, the song was not about David Bowie's first wife Angela; Richards's daughter Dandelion Angela had just been born, and the name was Richards's main contribution to the lyrics.\n\nDespite its laid-back sound, many of Goats Head Soup's songs have a darker quality to them, such as the opener \"Dancing With Mr. D\" (D as in Death). An alternate version can be heard on bootlegs that features a ripping Mick Taylor guitar solo that was not featured on the album version.\n\nAlso featured is the Top 20 US hit \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\", which criticizes the New York police for the accidental shooting of a 10-year-old.\n\nThis was the last Rolling Stones album produced by Jimmy Miller, who'd worked with the band since 1968's Beggars Banquet sessions. Miller developed a debilitating drug habit from his years spent with the band.\n\nAside from the official band members, other musicians appearing on Goats Head Soup include keyboard players Billy Preston, Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart.\n\nRecording was completed in January 1973 in Los Angeles and May 1973 at London's Olympic Sound Studios.\n\n\nRelease and aftermath\nAt the time of release, Jagger said, \"I really feel close to this album, and I really put all I had into it... I guess it comes across that I'm more into songs. It wasn't as vague as the last album which kind of went on so long that I didn't like some of the things. There's more thought to this one. It was recorded all over the place over about two or three months. The tracks are much more varied than the last one. I didn't want it to be just a bunch of rock songs.\"\n\nPreceded by \"Angie\" as the lead single, which sailed to #1 in the United States and became a worldwide hit, Goats Head Soup was released in late August 1973 and also shot to #1 worldwide. The Rolling Stones' autumn 1973 European Tour followed soon after, in which three slots in the set list were given to the new material. (The popular bootleg recording Brussels Affair would result from this tour.)\n\nCritical reaction to the album was varied at the time. Bud Scoppa called the album \"one of the year's richest musical experiences\"[2] in Rolling Stone, while Lester Bangs derided the effort in Creem, saying, \"There is a sadness about the Stones now, because they amount to such an enormous 'So what?' The sadness comes when you measure not just one album, but the whole sense they're putting across now against what they once meant...\n\nGoats Head Soup is now generally considered to have marked the end of the Stones' \"golden age\", with Stephen Thomas Erlewine saying, \"Sliding out of perhaps the greatest winning streak in rock history, the Stones slipped into decadence and rock star excess with Goats Head Soup... This is where the Stones' image began to eclipse their accomplishments, as Mick ascended to jet-setting celebrity and Keith slowly sunk deeper into addiction, and it's possible hearing them moving in both directions on Goats Head Soup, at times in the same song.\"[4] Goats Head Soup has endured as a popular seller and has gone triple platinum in the United States.\n\nThe album cover was designed by Ray Lawrence and photographed by David Bailey, a friend of Jagger's who had worked with The Rolling Stones since 1964. The portrait of Jagger on the front cover was approximately life size in the original 12 inch LP format.\n\nThe album title is a reference to the Jamaican dish, Mannish Water.\n\nThe sessions for Goats Head Soup were abundant with outtakes. Two of these - \"Tops\" and \"Waiting on a Friend\" - would surface on Tattoo You in 1981, and feature Mick Taylor on guitar; \"Through the Lonely Nights\" became the B-side to the \"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)\" single and was released on CD for the first time on the 2005 compilation Rarities 1971–2003.\n\nIn 1994 Goats Head Soup was remastered and reissued by Virgin Records, and again in 2009 by Universal Music. The UMG remaster features a censored version of \"Star Star\" (the band always referred to it as \"Starfucker\") that was featured on the original vinyl release, but not on the 1994 Virgin CD.\n\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.\n\nSide one \n\"Dancing with Mr. D\" – 4:53 \n\"100 Years Ago\" – 3:59 \n\"Coming Down Again\" – 5:54 \n\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\" – 3:27 \n\"Angie\" – 4:33 \nSide two \n\"Silver Train\" – 4:27 \n\"Hide Your Love\" – 4:12 \n\"Winter\" – 5:31 \n\"Can You Hear the Music?\" – 5:31 \n\"Star Star\" – 4:25 \n\n[edit] Personnel\nThe Rolling Stones \nMick Jagger – lead and backing vocals, acoustic guitar and harmonica, piano on \"Hide Your Love\" \nKeith Richards – guitar, lead vocals on \"Coming Down Again\", backing vocals, electric and acoustic guitar, bass guitar on \"Silver Train\" \nMick Taylor – electric, acoustic, and slide guitar, bass guitar on \"Dancing with Mr. D\" and \"Coming Down Again\", lead guitar on \"Hide Your Love\", backing vocals on \"100 Years Ago\" \nCharlie Watts – drums \nBill Wyman – bass guitar \nAdditional musicians \nNicky Hopkins – piano on \"Dancing with Mr. D\", \"Coming Down Again\", \"Angie\", \"Winter\", and \"Can You Hear the Music?\" \nBilly Preston – piano, organ, clavinet on \"100 Years Ago\" and \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\", percussion \nIan Stewart – piano on \"Silver Train\" and \"Star Star\" \nBobby Keys – saxophone \nJim Price – saxophone \nJim Horn – flute \nChuck Finley – trumpet \nAnthony \"Rebop\" Kwaku Baah – percussion \nPascal – percussion \nNicky Harrison – string arrangement \nJimmy Miller – percussion \n\n\n\n\nChart positions\nAlbum \nYear Chart Position \n1973 UK Top 50 Albums 1\n1973 Billboard Pop Albums 1\nSingle \nYear Single Chart Position \n1973 \"Angie\" UK Top 50 Singles 5\n1973 \"Angie\" The Billboard Hot 100 1\n1973 \"Angie\" Adult Contemporary 38\n1974 \"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker)\" The Billboard Hot 100 15\n <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+Rolling+Stones/Goats+Head+Soup\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

They got together to rehearse new songs in February 2009 in a rented house outside Seattle, but the sessions were mostly scrapped. As a result of those wasted sessions, the band lost $60,000 of their own money. After their tour in support of the 2008 releases ended, the band's singer-songwriter mentioned the possibility of starting to record new songs, but Joshua Tillman, Fleet Foxes' drummer and co-song arranger, was scheduled to play Europe and North America all along the 2009-10 winter as part of his solo musical act. Added to this, Philip Ek, the band's producer and friend answered in an interview that he was likely to continue as the producer as Robin had already sent him some demos to start listening to. In an interview with Pitchfork, Pecknold stated he expected the album to be released sometime in the second half of 2010. The incredible care Pecknold put into the album was painstaking, creating turmoil in his personal relationships. In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Pecknold admitted that his girlfriend of five years found the stress this album placed on their relationship too much, and ended things. Upon hearing the completed album, she realized that Pecknold's efforts were worth it and they are working it out.\n\nPecknold has come out saying for their second album he tried to sound \"less poppy, less upbeat and more groove-based\". Taking inspiration from Roy Harper's psychedelic folk album Stormcock, or at least its 12-string guitar he said: \"That will be the primary sonic distancing from the last record\". Added to this, he stated they wanted to record very quickly, saying he wanted to do the \"vocal takes in one go, so even if there are fuck-ups, I want them to be on there. I want there to be guitar mistakes. I want there to be not totally flawless vocals. I want to record it and have that kind of cohesive sound. Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, to me, is the best-sounding album because it sounds like there were only six hours in the universe for that album to be recorded in. So I want it to have that feeling.\"\n\nThe band had recorded since April 2010 in different locations (including West Hurley, New York) after two years of writing material and decided to scrap the earlier idea of a fast recording (though according to the band, the vocal takes as of yet have all been done in one take, perhaps in line with the original imperfect recording idea).\n\nIn a press release from the band on January 31st, 2011, it was revealed that former Blood Brothers and Past Lives multi-instrumentalist Morgan Henderson had been officially added to the Fleet Foxes lineup.\n\nThe album cover was illustrated by Seattle artist Toby Liebowitz and painted by artist Christopher Alderson. The title track, \"Helplessness Blues\" was released via free download on January 31st, 2011, and the album's fourth track, \"Battery Kinzie\" premiered on Zane Lowe's show on March 22nd, 2011.

Released on April 1, 2003 on V2 Records, the album marks the band's major label debut. Despite this change, Heather Phares of Allmusic believed the album \"sounds even more pissed-off, paranoid, and stunning than its predecessor…Darker and more difficult than White Blood Cells.\" The record garnered much critical acclaim upon its release, and went on to win a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album in 2004.\n\nElephant\"  is a strong, deep album showcasing Jack White at the top of his game. He rocks every guitar style that he tries including blues and slide guitar and even does a great job on a Burt Bacharach cover. It's just one more  example of Detroit's enduring musical legacy. \n\nElephant was recorded in two weeks during 2002 in London's Toe Rag Studios. Jack White produced the album with antiquated equipment, including an eight-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear.\n\nThe album has been released with at least six different versions of the front cover—different covers for the CD and LP editions in the US, the UK and elsewhere. To give an example, on the US CD edition Meg White is sitting on the left of a circus travel trunk and Jack is sitting on the right holding a cricket bat over the ground, while on the UK CD edition the cricket bat touches the ground and the image is mirrored so that their positions on the amplifier are reversed. The cryptic symbolism of the album art includes a skull sitting on the floor in the background, as well as peanuts and peanut shells in the foreground, and on the circus travel trunk appears the mark \"III,\" Jack White's signature. Jack White is also displaying a mano cornuta, while Meg White appears to be barefoot and crying, with a rope tied around her ankle and leading out of frame. Both have small white ribbons tied to their fingers.\n\nIn an interview with Q Magazine in 2007, Jack White said, \"If you study the picture carefully, Meg and I are elephant ears in a head-on elephant. But it's a side view of an elephant, too, with the tusks leading off either side.\" He went on to say, \"I wanted people to be staring at this album cover and then maybe two years later, having stared at it for the 500th time, to say, 'Hey, it's an elephant!'\"\n\nThe White Stripes were gaining momentum with their previous three albums and were generally lauded in critical circles. Upon its release, critical response to this album was overwhelmingly positive, and many critics hailed it as the one of the defining events of the 2000s garage rock revival. Uncut magazine remarked that \"Elephant is where the tabloid phenomenon of summer 2001 prove they are no flash in the pan by making a truly phenomenal record.\" David Fricke (with Rolling Stone) called it \"a work of pulverizing perfection,\" adding, \"It will be one of the best things you hear all year.\" and Allmusic said the album \"overflows with quality\". Critics also commented on the development of the band. NME noted that \"The eloquence, barbarism, tenderness and sweat-drenched vitality of Elephant make it the most fully-realised White Stripes album yet.\" PopMatters said the album cemented \"their evolution from Blind Willie McTell cover band with a pop sensibility to full-fledged, honest-to-goodness rock 'n' roll gods.\" The album enjoys a metacritic rating of 92. Negative critique, though rare, was centered around the \"gimmicks\" that surround the music, most notably, the White Stripes' insistence on being called siblings. \"So maybe it's time to drop the enigmatic charade,\" Lorraine Ali (with Newsweek) pleaded, although she concluded, \"Elephant still sounds great.\"\n\nThe album debuted at number one in the United Kingdom and reached number six on the Billboard 200 in the US. The album won Grammys for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song (\"Seven Nation Army\"). In 2003, the album was ranked number 390 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. It was also placed thirty-ninth in Channel 4's list of the 100 Greatest Albums of all time. In December 2003, NME made it their Album of the Year. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/The+White+Stripes/Elephant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on March 27, 1991, through Touch and Go Records. Featuring dramatically alternating dynamics and vocals ranging from spoken word to shouting, the album contains narrative lyrics that emphasize alienation. Spiderland was Slint's first release on Touch and Go, and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.\n\nAlthough Spiderland was not widely recognized on its initial release, it eventually sold more than 50,000 copies and became a landmark album in underground music after Slint broke up. The album has been highly influential on the styles of many bands in the post-rock and math rock genres, including Mogwai and Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and has been named a favorite of several indie rock musicians. In 2007 and 2013–2014, Slint reunited for a tour consisting of performances of Spiderland in its entirety.\n\nSlint formed in 1987 in Louisville, Kentucky, from the remnants of the punk rock band Squirrel Bait; the founding members included Brian McMahan (guitar, vocals), David Pajo (guitar), Britt Walford (drums) and Ethan Buckler (bass guitar). The band's debut album, the Steve Albini-produced Tweez, was released on the group's self-owned label Jennifer Hartman Records and Tapes. The album's sound has been described as a combination of \"scratchy guitars, thumping bass lines and hard hitting drums\". Buckler promptly left the band out of dissatisfaction with Albini's production, and was replaced with Todd Brashear. The band's second recording was for the instrumental extended play Slint, which included a new version of \"Rhoda\" from Tweez. The EP, which would not be released until 1994, was a departure from Tweez's sound and reflected the band's new musical direction.\n\nAfter the band ended its brief tour in support of Tweez, most of its members attended college. Around this time McMahan and Walford began writing together for the band's next record, creating six new songs which the band practiced throughout the summer of 1990. Slint entered River North Records in August 1990 to record Spiderland. At that time there were no vocals or lyrics prepared for the album, so the band wrote them while in the studio. The album's producer, Brian Paulson, was known for his \"live\" recording style in the studio, with minimal takes. Paulson recalled \"It was weird while I was doing [Spiderland] because I remember sitting there, and I just knew there was something about it. I've never heard anything like this. I'm really digging this but it's really fucking weird.\"\n\nThe recording sessions for Spiderland are reputed to have been difficult for the members of the band and were, according to AllMusic, \"intense, traumatic and one more piece of evidence supporting the theory that band members had to be periodically institutionalized during the completion of the album.\" Rumors circulated that at least one member of Slint had been checked into a psychiatric hospital. Walford later addressed these stories in an article in Select by saying, \"[We were] definitely trying to be serious about things, pretty intense, which made recording the album kinda stressful.\" The recording was completed in four days. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Slint/Spiderland\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Written and recorded following a six-month hiatus from band activities, the album was produced by bassist and multi-instrumentalist Chris Taylor, and preceded by the singles, \"Sleeping Ute\" and \"Yet Again\". Shields has been described as the band's most collaborative album, with vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen noting, \"The band's aim was to write and make music that is as collaborative as possible, so that we have a product that we all feel a sense of authorship over as a collective.\" The album received acclaim upon release. Shields reached a peak position of #17 on the UK Albums Chart and #7 on the Billboard 200. After extensive touring in support of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, \"There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence that had nothing to do with music. That was really good for everybody.\"Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, \"Those were strange times... I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry.\" \n\nDuring the break, bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor released a solo album, Dreams Come True (2011), under the pseudonym CANT, stating, \"I can't just take a break. For whatever reason, I'm the kind of person who needs to constantly to work on stuff. When we finished touring, I didn't want to take some time off, I just wanted to go into the studio. But, I really didn't want to book myself in with a band and go record them, so I decided I'd try and make my own record.\" Daniel Rossen recorded and released a solo EP, Silent Hour/Golden Mile (2012), featuring tracks initially intended for Shields. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Grizzly+Bear/Shields\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
